# Roman Numeral Converter

A sleek and user-friendly web application that converts decimal numbers to Roman numerals.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and responsive user interface
- Real-time conversion
- Input validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Roman.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page
- `Roman.css`: Stylesheet for styling the application
- `Roman.js`: JavaScript file containing the conversion logic and event handling
- `README.md`: This file, containing project documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## 📖 How to Use

1. Open the `Roman.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 3999 in the input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button.

## 🎨 Customization

Feel free to modify the `Roman.css` file to change the look and feel of the application. You can easily adjust colors, fonts, and layout to match your preferences.

## 🧠 How It Works

The conversion algorithm in `Roman.js` uses a mapping of decimal values to Roman numeral symbols. It iterates through the mapping, building the Roman numeral string by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
